The purpose of this project is to create a simple day planner with jQuery and Moments.js. 
The planner should accurately display the current date and time at the top of the application
It should list the work hours from 9-5 in hour long blocks, and they should be color coded to reflect if the hour has passed, is current, or has yet to happen
You should be able to write an event or activity in a field next to the time listing, and have an option to save the action and time to local storage
